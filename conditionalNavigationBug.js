In Next.js 15, a subtle bug can occur when using the `next/navigation` client-side routing functions within a component that's conditionally rendered.  If the component containing the navigation function isn't initially rendered (e.g., based on some initial state or prop), calling `router.push` or similar might fail silently, resulting in no navigation. This is because the router instance isn't fully initialized until after the component mounts.
